# Superstore Sales Analysis Project Report

## Introduction

In this data analysis project, I explored a comprehensive Superstore Sales dataset from Kaggle website to unearth valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, product popularity, and geographical sales distribution. Utilizing SQL for data querying and Tableau for visualization, I conducted a deep-dive analysis, deriving meaningful patterns and trends to inform business strategies.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project was to analyze historical sales data to understand sales trends, identify high-performing product categories, assess customer behavior, and evaluate geographical sales distribution. This information would then be used to make data-driven recommendations for business growth and optimization.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises sales data from a superstore, including details like order date, ship date, customer name, product category, sales, profit, and more. The data was loaded into a Microsoft SQL Server database, and SQL queries were used for data extraction and analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
Microsoft SQL Server: Used for storing the dataset and executing SQL queries.
Tableau: Used for creating interactive and insightful visualizations.

## Methodology

Data Importation and Cleaning:
The dataset was imported into Microsoft SQL Server.
Data types and null values were checked and handled to ensure data integrity.

## SQL Analysis:
SQL queries were written and executed to calculate total sales revenue, average order size, and to perform various aggregations and calculations.
The data was grouped, sorted, and filtered to analyze different aspects of sales performance.

## Tableau Visualization:
The SQL query results were used to create visualizations in Tableau.
Different chart types were used to represent the data, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.

## Key Findings

### Sales Performance

The total sales revenue for the dataset period was approximately $2.26 million.
Sales demonstrated an upward trend year by year, with the highest sales recorded in 2018.

### Product Analysis

Technology products were the top-performing category, generating the highest sales.
Phones and Chairs were the top-selling sub-categories.

### Customer Analysis

The top 10 customers were identified, with Sean Miller being the highest spender.
The Consumer segment contributed the most to sales, followed by Corporate and Home Office.

### Geographical Analysis

The West and East regions led in sales, with California and New York being the top-performing states.
New York City and Los Angeles were the cities with the highest sales.

### Order and Shipping Analysis

The average sales amount per order was approximately $230.77.
Standard Class was the most used shipping mode, though it had the longest average delivery time.

### Recommendations
Focus on Top-Performing Categories and Products: Increase marketing and promotional efforts for Technology products and top-selling sub-categories.

#### Customer Engagement: 

Develop loyalty programs for top customers and increase engagement in the Consumer segment.

#### Geographical Expansion: 

Strategize to increase market penetration in regions and states with lower sales.
Optimize Shipping: Analyze the feasibility of faster shipping options to enhance customer satisfaction.

## Conclusion
This project provided comprehensive insights into the sales operations of the Superstore, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for growth. 
The combination of SQL analysis and Tableau visualizations facilitated a deep understanding of the data, leading to informed recommendations for strategic business decisions.
